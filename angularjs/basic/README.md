Key features of AngularJS include:

Two-Way Data Binding: AngularJS synchronizes data between the model and the view components. This means that when the model changes, the view updates automatically and vice versa.

Dependency Injection: AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection subsystem that helps with managing components and their dependencies, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.

Directives: AngularJS extends HTML with additional attributes called directives. These directives can be used to create custom HTML tags, attributes, and classes that encapsulate complex logic and behaviors.

MVC Architecture: AngularJS follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps in organizing the applicationâ€™s code and separating concerns.

Templating: AngularJS uses HTML templates to define the user interface of the application. These templates are compiled by the AngularJS compiler, which then updates the view dynamically.

Routing: AngularJS provides a routing mechanism that allows developers to define multiple views within the application and navigate between them.

Community and Ecosystem: Although AngularJS has been succeeded by Angular (a complete rewrite of AngularJS), it still has a significant community and a rich ecosystem of plugins, tools, and libraries.
